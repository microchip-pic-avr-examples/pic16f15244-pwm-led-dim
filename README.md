# Dim an LED using PWM with PIC16F15244

The 'pic16f15244-pwm-led-dim' code example uses the PIC16F15244 Curiosity Nano Development board to demonstrate how to use the PWM module to dim an LED.

## Operation
The code example cycles through four different PWM configurations to demonstrate the effects each PWM duty cycle has on LED0. At power-up, the PWM module is confiugured to provide a 25% duty cycle to LED0. This means that LED0 is illuminated only 25% of each PWM cycle, and the LED will appear to be dimly lit.

When push-button SW0 is pressed once, the PWM module is reconfigured to provide a 50% duty cycle, which means LED0 is illuminated 50% of each PWM period. This results in a slightly brighter LED output.

When SW0 is pressed a second time, the PWM module is reconfigured to provide a 75% duty cycle, which means LED0 is illuminted 75% of the time. This results in an even brighter LED output.

When SW0 is pressed a third time, the PWM module is reconfigured to provide a 100% duty cycle, which means the LED will be turned on the entire PWM period. This results in the LED providing full illumination.

When SW0 is pressed a fourth time, the program returns to the default configuration of 25% duty cycle. Each time SW0 is pressed, the program reconfigures the PWM duty cycle. Figure 5 shows the program flowchart.

## Summary
The 'pic16f15244-pwm-led-dim' code example highlights the use of the PWM module to change the brightness of an LED.
